\# Homework #1: Auto and Range-Based Loops



\## Task Description

This program demonstrates the use of template functions in C++ to iterate over STL containers using:



1\. \*\*Range-based loops\*\* – to print all elements of a container.

2\. \*\*Iterators\*\* with `auto` – to print all elements of a container while showing the iterator's type.



The goal is to practice writing generic (template) functions and understand the use of modern loop constructs in C++.



\## Files

\- `main.cpp` – Main source file containing all template functions and program logic.

\- (You can add more file descriptions here if needed.)



\## Compilation and Execution

```bash

g++ -std=c++17 -o program main.cpp

./program
